### Part 1
The imaging techniques are inspired by Impressionism and Neo-Impressionism. They present real-life scenes in the form of blended patches of colour on the artwork. It's a very creative way of processing images. Pointillism, where the painting is composed of patches or blocks of similar colours, was a common technique they used.
This imaging technique can be applied to our Major projects to reconstruct existing artwork and create something more by changing the parameters.
### Part 2
I have discovered a technique called Pixel painter in the happycoding.io website. It creates spots by randomly selecting pixel points from the original image and repeating them to create a pointillism-like artwork.
Based on this technique, we can modify the style and conditions of the generated patterns. This makes the texture of the artwork more complex and interesting.
